```css
/* Written horizonally, this means the same as... */
h1 {color: black; text-align: center;}

/* ...written vertically. */
h1 {
  color: black;
  text-align: center;
}
```
<span class="label label-info">NOTE:</span> CSS is not whitespace dependent. In other words, you do not need to include extra lines between rules. However, this shown style increases readability of your code. _It's polite._
