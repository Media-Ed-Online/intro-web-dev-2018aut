<div class="divider-heading"></div>

Once you have created your CSS document, you need to connect it to your HTML page using the **link element**. This element <b>must</b> be placed in the `<head>` of the HTML page, and each CSS document you create will need a corresponding link element.

<span class="label label-info">Note</span> This means you can have as many separate CSS documents as you want, as long as each gets their own link element.

The 4 attributes an image element should include are:

1. The tag itself.
2. The relationship attribute.
3. The type attribute.
4. The href attribute.
