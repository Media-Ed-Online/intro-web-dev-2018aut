<div class="divider-heading"></div>

In CSS, comments are placed inside of a “forward-slash + star” set (`/*...*/`).

<span class="label label-info">Note</span> Comments are not hidden from _other people_. Comments, if included in your deployment code, will be available for the whole world to see.


<div id="code-heading">CSS</div>
```css
/* This is a CSS comment. */


/* Everything placed between the forward-slash+star pair is part of the comment. */

/*
Comments in CSS are known as “block-comments,”
which means they can span multiple lines!

Notice how the comment delineators are placed on
lines above and below the text respectively.
*/
```
