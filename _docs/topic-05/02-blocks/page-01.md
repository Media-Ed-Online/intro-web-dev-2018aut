<div class="divider-heading"></div>

At this point, we have covered the main tags that fit nicely into groups and sections.
In this chapter, we will focus on some helpful topics that are not easily grouped together. You will learn about:
● The different versions of HTML and how to indicate which version you are using
● How to add comments to your code
● Global attributes, which are attributes that can be used on
any element, including the class and id attributes
● Elements that are used to group together parts of the page
where no other element is suitable
● How to embed a page within a page using iframes
● How to add information about the web page using the <meta> element
● Adding characters such as angled brackets and copyright symbols
