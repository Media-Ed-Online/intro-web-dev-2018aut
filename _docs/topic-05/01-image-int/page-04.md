<div class="divider-heading"></div>

As stated in the introduction, the **image element** is a multi-part element comprised of several "commands" over how the image will render.

The 5+ attributes an image element <i>should</i> include are:

- The tag itself.
- The source attribute (location of the file).*
- Alternative text.*
- The image itle.
- Width and height values (which also can be accomplished with the style attribute).

<span class="label label-danger">Important</span> *The source (`src=""`) and alternative text (`alt=""`) attributes are <b>required</b> in the image element.
