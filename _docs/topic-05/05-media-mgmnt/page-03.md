All media you use on your sites should be your own or in "fair public use," usually under [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) (CC) public licence. **You should always credit the author when asked to do so.**

<span class="label label-danger">Important</span> Test your pages on multiple computers and browsers to make sure the embedded media works.


## How-To Source Video:

 A cellphone video is a good option, or [The Moving Image Archive](https://archive.org/details/movies) has Creative Commons video that you can download, which conveniently show metadata like size and filetype. Here's an example about [Pluto](https://archive.org/details/Pluto_Flyby):

<div class="external-embed" style="width: 400px;">
  <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/237977600?autoplay=0&loop=1&color=E95420&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" width="400" height="300" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<span class="label label-success">Neat-O</span> Hovering your cursor over the download link will show you the file's size. Most videos give you the two required options you need: H.264 (`.mp4`) and an open-source type (`.ogg`).
