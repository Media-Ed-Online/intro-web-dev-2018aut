<div class="divider-heading"></div>

An input element is a combination of type, name, and identification. The following code shows an "input" element, wrapped in a "form" element, along with the three _required_ attributes.


<div id="code-heading">HTML</div>
```html
<input type="" name="" id="" />

<!-- For example... -->
<input type="text" name="username" id="username_input" />
```


The `<form>` is improving with the addition of `<input>` elements. Specifing **input types** is where the real magic happens.
