<div class="divider-heading"></div>

The **input element** is used to collect data from users. This is an element that you will likely use most-often as a web developer. The data collected by this element can be sent as part of a bunch of data in a form element to a server. This element can also be accessed through client-side JavaScript, allowing developers to create ways of getting data they can process on the client-computer.

The 4 attributes an input element should include are:

1. The tags themselves.
2. Type.
3. Name.
4. id.
