<div class="divider-heading"></div>

We will not create functional forms this semester, as they inherently require a more robust language to handle their collection and transmission. This is one of the roles of **JavaScript**, which will be discussed more in the second Web course ("Web Technologies").

What we _can_ do in our class is structue and design how the form will look. This is a large part in creating forms, so it's important we talk about them throughou

The 4 attributes a table element should include are:

1. The tags themselves.
2. The action attribute which links to a script.
3. A method which states the direction of the data.
4. Possibly an id and/or class to style the look.
