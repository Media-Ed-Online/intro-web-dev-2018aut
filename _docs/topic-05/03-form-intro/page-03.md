To include a form in a webpage we must declare a **form element** section. This is simply accomplished by using the `<form>...</form>` tags.

Between these tags will be separate form elements such as _text boxes_ and _buttons_ that we will discuss in the proceeding pages.

As with images, this element is reliant on attributes within the tag to allow it to be useful. Visit the next pages to learn these attributes.
