Another set of attributes you should add every time is `width=""` & `height=""`. The values passed to these attributes are a string with an integer, representing the **width and height** that the image is to be displayed at.

In most situations, _the width and height of the image file should be the same width and height that you enter as attributes_ and want used in your web page. In the case that these differ, these attributes will scale the image file to the specified size passed to the attributes.
