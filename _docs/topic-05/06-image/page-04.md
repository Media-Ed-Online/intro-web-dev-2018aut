The first attribute that we will need to consider is `src=""`. Within the double quotes you will need to include a **URL source** to the location of the desired image.

This will typically be a **relative URL** to a file stored on the same server as the web page, but can also be an **absolute URL** to an image anywhere on the Internet.
