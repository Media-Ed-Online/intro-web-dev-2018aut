<h2 style="text-align: center;">05: Managing Media</h2>

It's time to get into the juicier HTML elements. This Topic, you'll be introduced to some multi-part elements, including images, audio/video, and iframes, and well as the basic building blocks of page design.

When thinking about the sites you often visit, images are probably the first memorable element that comes to mind, but there are also other media types used in web developmen. As designers, we need to consider how and when to add media, what filetypes to use, their file sizes, and what code element works best for each specific situation.

This is the last Topic where we will look at HTML elements in depth. At the point you should be comfortable with:

- The Basics of HTML, Including:
    - Elements
    - Tags
        - Attributes
        - Opening and Closing Tags
        - Empty Tags
- The Basic Structure of an HTML Document:
    - The HTML Element
    - The Head and Body Elements
- Structural vs. Semantic Elements
- Nesting Elements
- Linking to Other Files (i.e. Images)
- User Input

This week we will be wrapping up our unit on HTML by looking at three groups: additional structural elements, media, and metadata.


By the end of this Topic, we hope you:
- Have experimented with using `<div>`s to structure the contents of your pages.
- Understand how media is placed and accessed on the internet (hosted vs. streaming).
- Source and reference outside materials directly within your site pages.
