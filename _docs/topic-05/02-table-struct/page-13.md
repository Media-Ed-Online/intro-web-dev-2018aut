<div class="divider-heading"></div>

In learning HTML, we can also use tables to organize less-complex (non-statistical) infomation. Tables can also break up linear information groups; for example, homweork step numbers, step details, and step images).

However, once we hit CSS, you should use stylesheets instead of HTML to organize text-based sets such as these. This is primarily because tables can be difficult for accessibility software to translate if done improperly.

The 4 attributes a table element <i>should</i> include are:

- The tag itself.
- Rows made of cells.
- Cells containing information.
- Headings.
