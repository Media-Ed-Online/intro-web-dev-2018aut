## “Okay, yikes. So what are other types of plain text-based file types?”

Well, as you might guess, most computer languages are saved as plain text or ASCII files. However, they often have different extensions. These extensions provide information to the computer, as well as to the user as to ‘how’ the file may be used or _compiled_.

In this class, we will be using the following text file types;

- Markdown; `.md`
- HyperText Markup Language (HTML); `.html`
- Cascading Style Sheet (CSS); `.css`

This Topic, we'll look at the first type, Markdown or `.md` files, using a text editor.

In the upcoming Topics, we'll even begin looking at `.html` files and beginning structure.
