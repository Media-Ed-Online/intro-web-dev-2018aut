### What is web development?
_Web Development_ is broad term that is intended to cover the technical process of creating, building, and maintaining a website for the internet. As such, this course will take a technical approach, with the goal of assisting you in gaining comfort and skill in the technologies and concepts of modern web development.


### What _isn't_ web development?
Web development is not necessarily _web design_, although web design is an aspect of development. Web design is focused on creating the aesthetic feel/look, user experience, and flow of content (although the last of these could actually be considered _content development_).

Web design is a critical part of web development and we will spend some time discussing user experience design (UX), layout and flow, modern design elements, and content creation. These ideas will be discussed within the presentation of techniques and technology. The reason for this is to start creating a gestalt between your creative ideas and technical abilities.
