[GitHub.com](https://github.com/) uses markdown extensively within its ecosystem for documentation, README files, as well as allowing for issues to be written using markdown.

When we start developing sites in the next few topics, you'll add a README file to your repository to tell other people why your project is useful, what they can do with your project, and how they can use it.

If you put your README file in your repository's root directory, GitHub will recognize and automatically surface your README to repository visitors. Don't worry if this doesn't quite make sense yet: we can provide an example! Go ahead, <a href="{{ site.git_address }}#readme" target="_blank">check ours out</a>.

**For every project you submit, you will also write a short report in markdown.** This report is the `README.md` for that directory, and should discuss a number of things every week:

- Summarize the work you did this cycle, paying particular attention to the individual choices you made.
- Did you have any problems or issues? How did you solve these?
- Is there anything in particular you learned that you would like to discuss further?
- Did you post any of your problems to issues to the repo? What issues did you help your fellow classmates out with this past homework cycle?
