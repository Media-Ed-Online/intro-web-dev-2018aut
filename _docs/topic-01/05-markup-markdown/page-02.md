Just as in HTML, **markdown files** encourage the writer to focus on *content and structure,* as opposed to formatting. In fact, this entire course has been developed for the web using markdown files. In other words, at this very moment, you are reading a markdown file.

A markdown file typically uses the `.md` extension.

For example, this page's file is `intro-markdown.md`.

This file type allows the writer to identify portions of the text as headers (at various levels), paragraphs, bold, italic, links, code, lists, and tables. It also allows the writer to easily include images through links in the document. Below is an example of markdown.


<div id="code-heading">Markdown</div>
```markdown
