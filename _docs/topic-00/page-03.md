This site, [{{ site.url }}]({{ site.url }}), is where most of your learning materials are hosted. Please bookmark it!

In addition, you'll need to visit our Resources repo often to access the Issues board and earn participation points. Click the &nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Media-Ed-Online/intro-web-dev-resources-summer/issues"><i class="fa fa-github fa-lg"></i></a> &nbsp; icon from the navigation menu above to visit the Issues board at any time.

Our course follows a similar pattern as many site do across the web, linking multiple interfaces together. You're aware of Moodle, but we also rely heavily on GitHub as both a learning resource and hosting service for your work.
