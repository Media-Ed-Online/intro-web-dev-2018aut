<div class="divider-heading"></div>

There are a number of elements which we can consider as required in the **head element**, and others that you are _encouraged_ to include. These elements tell the browser and processor information about the HTML document, such as the title, author, and publication date.

<div class="lightbulb-container">
  <span class="fa-stack fa-1x">
    <i class="far fa-lightbulb fa-stack-2x"></i>
    <i class="fas fa-lightbulb fa-stack-2x lightbulb-blink"></i>
    <i class="far fa-lightbulb fa-stack-2x"></i>
  </span>
</div>
_Remember?_ The `<head>` element is a container for processing information and document metadata. The `<head>` contains high-level information about the site, and always comes first within the root element. In this sense, we can consider the `<head>` to contain the thoughts of the page.


<div id="code-heading">HTML</div>
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- Meta data and information about your site, not visible to visitors. -->
  </head>

</html>
```


The following pages provide you a proper order of placement of elements within the `<head>`; however, there is no strict documentation on this order.
