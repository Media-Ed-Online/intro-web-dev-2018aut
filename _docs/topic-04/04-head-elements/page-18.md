<div class="divider-heading"></div>

The _link_ element tells a browser about other resources that the page may need to load. Typically, these are the **CSS** or “stylesheets” which dictate how a page will appear in a browser.

We will not use this element for the first few weeks, but will rely upon it for the remainder of the semester after we start with CSS.

<span class="label label-info">Note</span> This element only requires an opening tag, as all information for the element is contained as attributes within the opening tag. This is another example of an **empty element.**


<div id="code-heading">HTML</div>
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- Other meta elements -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./css/style.css">

  </head>

</html>
```
