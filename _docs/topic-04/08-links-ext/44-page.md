<div class="divider-heading"></div>

With **links** being such a basic and historical part of the Internet, they  also have a very simple tag; `<a>...</a>`. Any text between a hyperlink element’s tags will display as “hypertext”. Traditionally, this has been blue, underlined text, visually signifying to the user that <a href="#" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline">the text is a link</a>.

In order to link to another document, the author must include a **hyper-reference** attribute within the opening tag. This attribute is signified with `href=""`.

<span class="label label-info">Note</span> `#` is a URL placeholder.


<div id="code-heading">HTML</div>
```html
<a href="#">link text</a>
```


<div class="codepen-embed">
  <p data-height="400" data-theme-id="30567" data-slug-hash="aLWJpd" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="Media-Ed-Online" data-pen-title="HTML Links (No Target)" class="codepen"></p>
