<div class="divider-heading"></div>

Just like bold, another very common semantic alteration is the use of _italicized text_. Text can be marked up as italicized with the use of the **italic element**, `<i>...</i>`.

As with bold/strong, italicized text does not necessarily imply semantically different meaning. Instead, you are encouraged to use the _"emphasis"_ element instead ( `<em>...</em>` ). The **emphasis** element indicates subtle changes in the meaning of a sentence. By default the browser will show these elements in italic.


<div id="code-heading">HTML</div>
```html
<p>This is an element is in <i>italics</i>, and will appear slanted.</p>

<p>This is an element is <em>emphasized</em>, and will also appear slanted.</p>
```


<div class="codepen-embed">
  <p data-height="400" data-theme-id="30567" data-slug-hash="rGOPKj" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="Media-Ed-Online" data-pen-title="Semantic HTML , Bold and Strong" class="codepen"></a>
</div>
