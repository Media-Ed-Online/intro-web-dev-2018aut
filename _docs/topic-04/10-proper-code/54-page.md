<div class="row">
  <p>It may seem ridiculous or silly, but there's such a thing as being a respectful dev that writes clean, proper code.</p>

  <img src="../img/nedry.gif" alt="Dennis Nedry gif from Jurassic Park" title="Ah ah ah!" style="float: right; width: 150px; margin-top: 0;" />

  <p>What does this look like? Well, a site with well-written markup will have:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Logical or Liner Ordering</li>
    <li>Properly Nested Tags</li>
    <li>Indented Elements</li>
  </ol>

  <p>There are many other unspoken rules you can Google, but those 3 are my major pet peeves when done poorly - <i>and I'm likely to call you out on them.</i></p>
