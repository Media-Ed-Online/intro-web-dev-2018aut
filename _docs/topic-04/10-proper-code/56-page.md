<div class="divider-heading"></div>

We "wrap" elements in opening and closing tags, as you know. You're now familiar with single-tag element sets like `<p>...</p>`, but elements can actually have multiple sets of tags. It's considered proper to layer these sets in concentric orbits around the element.

This basically looks like `<tag3><tag2><tag1>...</tag1></tag2></tag3>`


<div id="code-heading">HTML</div>
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
  <body>

    <!-- From a recently released deleted scene: -->
    <p>Spengler: "There's something very important I forgot to tell you."</p>
    <p>Venkman:  "What?"</p>
    <p>Spengler: "Dont cross the streams."</p>
    <p>Venkman:  "Why?"</p>
    <p>Spengler: "It would be bad."</p>
    <p>Spengler: "Almost as bad as <u><i>improperly nesting HTML tags.</u>"</p></i>
    <p>Venkman:  "What's proper?"</p>
    <p>Spengler: <u><i>"This."</i></u>.</p>

  </body>
</html>
```
