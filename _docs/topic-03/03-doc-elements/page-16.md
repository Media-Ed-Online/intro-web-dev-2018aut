<div class="divider-heading"></div>

Can you see how a single page is similar to how you're structured? **You only have one head and one body, and the head _always_ comes first.**

This is the basic layout of an HTML document.

<img src="../img/person-doc-structure.jpg" alt="stick figure representing head and body of an HTML document" title="Just like an HTML doc!" style="width: 100%; max-width: 700px; margin: auto;"/>
