<div class="divider-heading"></div>

The document type element is the first element in an HTML document, and should be placed on the first line in a document. This element tells the browser's processor what type of HTML document it is.

The `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration is not an HTML tag; it is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.


<div id="code-heading">HTML</div>
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

```
