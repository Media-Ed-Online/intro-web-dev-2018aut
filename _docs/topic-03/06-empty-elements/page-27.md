<div class="divider-heading"></div>

Like you saw in [Using Spaced Paragraphs](../breaks-paragraphs), if you want more control over how the contents of a paragraph appear, you can force a line break inside a paragraph using the **break** tag (`<br />`).


<div id="code-heading">HTML</div>
```html
<p>This is the first line in the paragraph.
<br />
Using a line break element, this is a separate line in the same paragraph.</p>
```

Compare this to Markdown:


<div id="code-heading" style="margin-top: 0 !important;">Markdown</div>
```markdown
This is the first line in the paragraph.
Separated by a single newline, this is a separate line in the same paragraph.
```


<div class="codepen-embed">
  <p data-height="600" data-theme-id="30567" data-slug-hash="qXwEbW" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="Media-Ed-Online" data-pen-title="HTML Paragraphs and Line Breaks" class="codepen"></p>
</div>
