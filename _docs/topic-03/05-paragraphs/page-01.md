<div class="divider-heading"></div>

Almost all non-heading text will be placed within a paragraph element in a web document. Paragraphs are defined with the `<p>` tags, and the element is written as `<p>...</p>`.


<div id="code-heading">HTML</div>
```html
<p>This is a paragraph element.</p>
```


Compare this to Markdown:


<div id="code-heading" style="margin-top: 0 !important;">Markdown</div>
```markdown
This is a paragraph.

In markdown, a paragraph requires no extra markup to signify it as such. An empty line between text blocks signifies a new paragraph.
```
