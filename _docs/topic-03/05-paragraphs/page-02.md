<div class="divider-heading"></div>

Any text between the paragraph tags `<p>...</p>` belongs to the same paragraph. This is the most common way of writing paragraphs in HTML pages.

You'll notice that when using Markdown, empty lines create paragraphs and provide cushion between one paragraph and the next. This is not true of HTML.

With HTML, paragraphs are made with tags, and browsers automatically add cushion above and below paragraph elements.
