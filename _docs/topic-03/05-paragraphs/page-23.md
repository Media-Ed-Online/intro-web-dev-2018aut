<div class="divider-heading"></div>

By default, browsers will remove empty spaces from paragraph element blocks. This is true of spaces and extra empty lines. You need to be aware that you cannot change the output of your rendered HTML code by adding extra spaces or lines unless you code for them; simply pressing space bar or return won't cut it.

You can see this below, where the first several paragraphs display as single lines. One way we can combat this is to use a **line break**, or the `<br />` tag. This will drop create a new line within a paragraph element.


<div class="codepen-embed">
  <p data-height="600" data-theme-id="30567" data-slug-hash="qXwEbW" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="Media-Ed-Online" data-pen-title="HTML Paragraphs and Line Breaks" class="codepen"></p>
</div>
