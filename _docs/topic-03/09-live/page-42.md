Okay, it's time for our first HTML coding experience and subsequent page. Writing it is only half the battle - we also need to figure out how to get it on the internet for others to view.

We are going to need to acquire **server space**. This is where we will store our files. Furthermore, this server will actually “serve” these files to requesting host-computers. In addition to acquiring a server, we will need to each get individual and unique URLs where we can point a computer to.

This is where [GitHub.com](https://github.com) really comes into play.
