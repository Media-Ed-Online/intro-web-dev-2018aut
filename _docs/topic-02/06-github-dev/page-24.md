## Adding, Tracking, and Reviewing Changes - Development in Action!
Whenever you commit new changes to your Git repo via GitHub Desktop, you need to remember to save any files and press “Push” or “Sync” when you are done working. This “pushes” your changes to the remotely-hosted version of your repository on GitHub.com, which we need to do in order to make a live site in the future.
