<i class="fas fa-long-arrow-alt-right" style="color: #20B5E9"></i> **https://www.example.com/about/images/profile.jpg**

An **absolute URL** contains all of the protocols and information for the file's location. If I am the owner of **www.another-example.com** and I want to link to "profile.jpg" I will need it's absolute URL (https://www.example.com/about/images/profile.jpg) as it lives on a separate site than mine.

We can compare this to needing to know the city, street, building, and apartment number of "profile.jpg" because we live in a different part of town.
