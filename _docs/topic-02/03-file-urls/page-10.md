<p style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 2px; margin: 3rem 0;">
  <i class="fas fa-long-arrow-alt-right" style="color: #DF382C"></i>
  <span style="font-family: monospace;">https://www.example.com/about/images/profile.png</span>

An **absolute URL** contains all of the protocols and information for the file's location. If I am the owner of **www.another-example.com** and I want to link to "profile.png" I will need it's absolute URL (https://www.example.com/about/images/profile.png) as it lives on a separate site than mine.

We can compare this to needing to know the city, street, building, and apartment number of "profile.png" because we live in a different part of town.

<img src="../img/url-building.gif" alt="apartment building" style="width: 400px;" />
<div class="img-caption">I'm coming from the city of Another-Example.com, so I need the full address to any files in Example.com!</div>
